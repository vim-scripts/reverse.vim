This file has a vim script to reverse the lines in the file.
(line 1 swapped with last line say 5, line 2 swapped with line4 ...)

I build it because I had such a requirement and could not 
think of anything quicker on Windows. 

Unix people have lot better tricks-). 


How to use :
Method 1: press <F2> if you wanna reverse all the lines
Method 2: select lines in visual mode and press <F2> 
                if you wanna swap only the highlighted lines
Method 3: To reverse line1 to line2 use :line1,line2 Reverse
